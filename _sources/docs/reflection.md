# Reflection and Group Distribution

## Reflection
During the work session on June 22nd, we received feedback from other students in our work group as well as our TA. In this section we will outline the feedback we received and how we implemented several changes. Based on the feedback we received we decided to implement a colour scheme to improve coherence and suggestivity in our visualizations, and remove unused variables from our multivariate plots. Additionaly we made the decision to add sources besides our visualizations to solidify our arguments and include a conclusion, as it would not be appropriate to end the data story on the last argument alone. We received additional feedback on the writing in our data story during the work session on June 27th. Based on this we decided to add some small text at the beginning of each perspective to make the story flow better.
