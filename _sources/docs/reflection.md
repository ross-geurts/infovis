# **Reflection and Work Distribution**

## **Reflection**
During the work session on June 22nd, we received feedback from other students as well as our TA. Based on the feedback we received we decided to implement a colour scheme to improve suggestiveness of our visualizations, and remove unused variables from our multivariate plots. Additionally we made the decision to add sources besides our visualizations to solidify our arguments and include a conclusion, as it would not be appropriate to end the data story on the last argument alone. We received additional feedback on the writing on June 27th. Based on this we decided to add some small text at the beginning of each perspective to make the story flow better. 

## **Work Distribution**
To make this project go as fluently as possible we made a plan to divide workload of both the programming and writing aspect of the project. DaniÃ«l made Figure 1 and Figure 7. Figure 2 en 3 were made by Gijs. Gijs also wrote the group distribution. Marijn made Figure 4 and wrote the introduction and conclusion. Ross made Figure 5 and 6 and wrote the dataset preprocessing and reflection.
