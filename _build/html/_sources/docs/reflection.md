# Reflection and Group Distribution

## Reflection
During the work session on June 22nd, we received feedback from other students in our work group as well as our TA. In this section we will outline the feedback we received and how we implemented several changes. A problem that was present in a few visualizations was that the colour usage was not suggestive enough, which we decided to change by having a set colour palette for all our visualizations to improve coherence and clarity. We also decided to remove some variables from our multivariate plots where the variables did not add anything to our arguments, like overall AQI value in figure 1 or methane emission in figure 3 and 5. Additionally we made the decision to add more sources to solidify our arguments, rather than suggest conclusions from the data alone. This ensures we are still able to give complete arguments even if there is not a dataset to make the visualization. Lastly we decided along with our TA to include a conclusion where we recapped all the arguments made in the data story, as it would not be appropriate to end the story on the last argument alone. 

We received additional feedback on the writing in our data story during the work session on June 27th. We received feedback on how to make the text in our data story flow better, for example by adding some small text at the beginning and end of each perspective to further outline the different arguments.
