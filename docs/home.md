# Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the Agricultural Sector of the Netherlands
## An Interactive Data Story


## Introduction
Climate change is a big problem all over the world. One of the main causes is the greenhouse gases that we as humans produce. The greenhouse effect is also an important topic of discussion in The Netherlands. According to politicians in the Netherlands, the Nitrous Oxide that the agricultural sector produces has a strong negative effect on the environment.  

When there is too much Nitrous Oxide, plants get too many nutrients, causing them to die <a href='https://www.zeeland.nl/onderwerpen/natuur-en-landschap/aanpak-stikstof/waarom-stikstof-een-probleem'>(Provincie Zeeland, n.d.)</a>. Therefore measures to reduce nitrous oxide emissions are taken that are disadvantageous to the farmers. They have  to reduce the size of their farm or in the worst case, they are bought out <a href='https://nos.nl/artikel/2431254-uitstoot-stikstof-moet-in-sommige-gebieden-met-70-tot-80-procent-omlaag'>(NOS News, 2022)</a>. Are these measures reasonable? 

On one hand, it is not fair that the farmers have to reduce their emissions because other sectors produce even more greenhouse gases and the government does not give those sectors any measures. On the other hand, global warming is a dangerous problem and everything should be done to stop it. The agricultural sector should reduce their emissions to better the climate and help to stop global warming.  In the data story, we are going to explore whether the Dutch agricultural sector needs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions or that there is no need to be taking any measures against the agricultural sector.
